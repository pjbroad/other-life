# How to build a package:
# Read the guides or at least install the necessary packages as detailed here:
# http://www.debian.org/doc/maint-guide/index.en.html
# https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Complete

# Set-up your ~/.bachrc so the package scripts known who you are:
# e.g. 
# export DEBFULLNAME='Paul Broadhead' 
# export DEBEMAIL='pjbroad@twinmoons.org.uk'

# If you're going to sign the package make sure you have keys set-up:
# https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto

# Now we're ready:

# Set the version number
olver="1.9.5.9"
packagename="otherlife-sound"
debdir="sound"

# start in the correct locatiion
cd other-life/ol_pkgfiles/debs
mkdir -p tmp
cd tmp

# Make a destination directory
tmpdir=${packagename}-${olver}-$(date +"%s")
mkdir $tmpdir
cd $tmpdir
mkdir ${packagename}-${olver}

# Copy packaging files:
cp -a ../../$debdir/debian/ ${packagename}-${olver}/

# Copy the licence file
cp /usr/share/games/OtherLife/license.txt ${packagename}-${olver}/debian/copyright

# Save the source archive:
tar cfz ${packagename}_${olver}.orig.tar.gz ${packagename}-${olver}

# Move into package directory:
cd ${packagename}-${olver}/

# Make any modifications required then update the changelog:
dch --release --force-save-on-release

# Build the package:
debuild
debuild -S -sa
